Academic excellence is evidenced in the rigor and vigor of our programs and also in the qualities of our alumni. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFearlessness\n\n\nWe facilitate a boundless learning environment across disciplines that integrate diverse perspectives into new knowledge and novel solutions to complex problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\n\n\nWe are honest and ethical in our actions, individually and collectively as an institution. Our integrative experiences, grounded in the liberal arts and sciences, cultivate intellectual and social responsibility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Freedom\n\n\nWe encourage freedom of thought and expression irrespective of ideological perspectives throughout our community of learners. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice\n\n\nWe bring our individual and collective resources to bear to seek positive transformation in our community and the world. We are always on guard against injustice and its causes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespect\n\n\nEmbracing our diversity creates a rich and welcoming atmosphere where the difference in culture, perspective, and belief enriches academic discourse and campus life and creates a sense of belonging for all community members. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWe are committed stewards of Arcadia, and we will ensure that decisions are made in accordance with our institutional mission, goals, and guidelines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose Arcadia for a lot of reasons. But the biggest ones for me were the environment of the campus and the community when I visited. I wanted to go somewhere where I would be close to people. I didn’t want to go to a big campus. Arcadia isn’t giant. And it felt right when I visited. It clicked.\n\n\nMichelle Teske ’26, Acting Major\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcadia is a Top-Ranked University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#1\nin PA and #9 nationally for study abroad*\n\n\n#1\nin the nation for undergraduate study abroad participation**\n\n\n11\nyears in a row on The Princeton Review’s Best Colleges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nArcadia University celebrates authenticity.
